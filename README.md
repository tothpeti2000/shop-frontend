## How to run the project?

- Run `npm install -g orval@6.10.2` to install the Orval client-side code generator
  ```
  The -g flag is needed because the post-build script of the backend uses the orval command
  Without setting the global flag, you would likely encounter a command not found error later on
  ```
- Run `npm install` to install the additional dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the development server
- Go to http://localhost:3000 after starting the backend to use the application
